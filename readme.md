### Origaminer. 

Time to put some new prints on my walls. Here's a little generative thing I've created to get the job done - a generator that spits out 18 variations of lovely origami-like figures - all in SVG, so that they'll scale well. There's no exporter at the moment. Simply use print to pdf (Chrome), if you want to export to a scaleable format. 

A click on a tile will generate a new _Origami_ like structure. Repeat until happy. Choose wisely.
